      fullDescription: "An innovative text analysis and visualization tool that extracts geographical locations mentioned in Arabic literature and displays them on an interactive map. The application uses advanced Natural Language Processing techniques specifically designed for Arabic text, including named entity recognition for location extraction. The tool processes Arabic books, identifies place names using CAMeL-Tools, geocodes them using OpenCage Geocoder, and creates beautiful interactive maps using Folium. This tool is particularly useful for literary analysis, historical research, and educational purposes.",
